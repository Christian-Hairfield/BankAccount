Programming Assignment 1 (PA1)

Due Jan, 28 at 11:30PM


(Bank Account) Write a program that inputs in the full name, street address, city, state, zip code, and social security for a new account. In addition, it inputs in the initial account balance and allows the user to make one deposit followed by two withdrawal transactions. Of course, if any of the withdrawal transactions would cause a negative account balance, your program should display an error message and exit. Also, you have to validate all the user’s input. For example, the zipcode must be 5 digits, the ssn is 9 digits with ‘-‘ as the separator, and all strings must not be empty.
Your program should calculate the ending balance after the withdrawal and deposit made by the account holder. It should also find the count of each one of these bills $100, $20, $10, $5, and $1 in the ending balance.
Your  program should then output all the collected data and the calculated results  in three main sections as shown in the Screen Shot below.

Here are some items that you need to consider while working on this assignment:
•	Scanner
•	printf
•	Naming constants (e.g., public static final int NUM = 2);
•	NumberFormat
•	String 

What to turn in:
•	BankAccount.java
Note: Check the Programming Style document posted in D2L to make sure your program meets the indentation, identifiers spellings, and comments requirements.
